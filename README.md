# KakaoTalk Application Clone

This is rare to write a study case for cloning an app, but I decided to have one for myself since it's almost impossible to track down 160 commits.

> KakaoTalk is one of the most famous free mobile instant messaging application for smartphones like "Whatsapp" with free text and free call features, operated by Kakao Corporation in S.Korea.

It is my first time building an app using only HTML and CSS. The main parts of the application are from the 'Kakao Clone' course by "Nomad Code," which is an online learning platform. I learned how HTML and CSS are actually used to create an app in real life. Not just copying the codes from the course, I also tried to make the app more realistic by adding more pages and complicated features. It took me 3 days to finish the project.

## What I learned:

1. Name the files using underscores(\_\_) to show the relationship between a parent and a child values
2. Recap HTML and CSS basic theory
3. How to post my git to Github using Github Desktop
4. The differences between `master` and `branch` in Github
5. How to make a link to showcase my project by creating a new branch named `gh-page`
6. Useful VS Code extensions

## What I added:

1. A profile page
2. Pop-up animation to notifications
3. Following the updated version design of the app (current version: 8.8.6)

## What I need to work on more:

1. `img alt="text"` is missing.
2. I did not know the importance of grouping commits before pushing to Github until the end of the course. I learned I should write a summary and description to review my codes later. Also, it seems like there are too many minor changes in each commit. Maybe using Inspector or Codepen might help to solve this problem.
3. Need to study more on the parts where the instructor did not explain specifically during the course. I am going to post this part in the 'Today I Learned' repository later.

Overall, I feel great to finish the project within the deadline and see the result of what I learned through the course even though there are some stuffs I need to work on more. I think it is still a good start though so that I can see my progress later down the road.
